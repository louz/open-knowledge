 * `handleShareConstructUrl` reads the project's local git state — HEAD branch,

 * marketing-safe share URL (`https://openknowledge.ai/d/<base64url>`). The

 * only (no `git ls-remote`) to keep the click-to-clipboard path under the

 *
 * Wire contract returns HTTP 200 for BOTH the happy path and the five
 * business-logic failures (no-remote / detached-head / branch-not-on-origin /
 * non-github-remote / invalid-path) — discriminated on `ok`. This is a
 * deliberate departure from the RFC 9457 problem+json convention used
 * elsewhere in the API: the share UI maps each failure code to a per-toast
 * string, and routing those branches through 4xx would conflate them with
 * transport errors (network drops, CSRF gate rejections) the client retries
 * differently. Wire transport errors still surface as RFC 9457 problem+json

/**
 * Closed enum of business-logic failure codes returned in the
 * `{ok: false, reason: code}` branch of `CheckoutResponseSchema`.
 *
 * - `dirty-conflict` — working-tree dirty files overlap with the file set
 *   that would change when switching to the target branch. `files` carries
 *   the offending paths so the dialog can name them verbatim.
 * - `branch-not-found` — the branch is not present locally AND `git fetch
 *   origin <branch>` failed with "couldn't find remote ref" (or equivalent).
 *   Means the branch was deleted upstream.
 * - `fetch-failed` — `git fetch origin <branch>` failed for a non-branch-
 *   not-found reason (network, auth, transport). Distinct from
 *   `branch-not-found` so the dialog can offer "retry / check connection"
 *   copy. Discriminator is the simple-git stderr message — if the message
 *   doesn't match the known "couldn't find remote ref" patterns, the
 *   conservative default is `fetch-failed`.
 * - `checkout-failed` — `git checkout <branch>` itself failed for any
 *   reason after the precondition gates passed (e.g. concurrent index
 *   contention not caught by `withParentLock`).
 * - `branch-in-other-worktree` — git refused the checkout because the
 *   requested branch is already checked out at another linked worktree
 *   (`fatal: '<branch>' is already checked out at '<path>'`). Distinct
 *   from `checkout-failed` so the dialog can offer "Open that worktree
 *   instead" instead of the generic "try switching manually" copy. The
 *   accompanying `otherWorktreePath` carries the realpath-collapsed path
 *   git reported.
 * - `ff-diverged` — only reachable with `fastForward: true`. The local branch
 *   and origin diverged, so the fast-forward-only pre-checkout update was
 *   refused and the checkout was NOT attempted (nothing mutated). The dialog
 *   offers a plain switch with an honest note; reconciliation is the sync
 *   engine's job — the receive flow never merges.

/**
 * Closed verdict enum for `POST /api/share/target-status` — why a receiver's
 * open of a share link missed, computed AFTER a targeted fetch:
 *
 * - `on-origin` — the target exists at `origin/<branch>`; the receiver's local
 *   ref was just stale (switch-and-update recovers it).
 * - `renamed` — git proves the target moved; `renamedTo` carries the new path
 *   (verified to exist at the origin ref before it is offered).
 * - `deleted` — a removal commit exists and it was not a rename.
 * - `never-on-branch` — the removal-commit lookup is EMPTY: the path never
 *   existed on this branch (e.g. never pushed). Messaged distinctly from
 *   `deleted` — never "removed".
 * - `changed-locally` — the target is still on `origin/<branch>` AND in the
 *   receiver's committed HEAD, but they removed or renamed it in their own
 *   working tree without syncing. They are NOT behind, so "pull" is the wrong
 *   guidance; the copy tells them they changed it locally.
 * - `unknown` — the fetch failed (offline / auth / timeout); the caller falls
 *   back to today's guidance.
 *
 * Closed for v1. Consumers parse tolerantly (see the response schema): an
 * unrecognized verdict a newer server adds degrades to `unknown` rather than a
 * parse failure, preserving the fail-open contract.
