/**
 * Resolve the effective `server.*` runtime settings from a merged `Config`.
 *
 * Two jobs no zod `.default()` can do:
 *
 *  1. **Alias-read of the superseded keys.** `server.publicUrl` (the former
 *     name of `server.externalUrl`) is read only while `server.externalUrl`
 *     is absent; `remote.url` only while both are absent; `remote.port` only
 *     while `server.port` is absent — the same shape as the
 *     `autoSync.enabled` → `autoSync.mode` alias. This resolver is the single
 *     alias-read point; no other reader should consult `remote.*` or
 *     `server.publicUrl` for these values.
 *
 *  2. **Derived defaults.** `openBrowser` and `idleShutdown` default off the
 *     resolved bind: a loopback-only server pops the UI and idles out after
 *     {@link DEFAULT_LOOPBACK_IDLE_SHUTDOWN}; an exposed or containerized
 *     server is headless and stays up. The local/hosted split is emergent
 *     from these values — there is deliberately no mode key to branch on.
 *
 * Enforcing the exposure interlock (refusing to boot when
 * {@link requiresExternalConsent} is true and `allowExternal` is not) is the
 * boot pipeline's job, not this resolver's — this module only computes the
 * predicate.

 * externalUrl is a project-scoped, committed, SHARED key (a team deploying to a
 * VPS legitimately commits `https://notes.example.com`), so refusing to boot
 * whenever it is set would lock out every teammate who clones that repo and
 * opens it locally (loopback bind) — especially in desktop, where
 * config-derived consent is forced off. Under a loopback bind a committed
 * externalUrl is inert metadata: nothing external reaches the server directly,
 * and a same-box reverse proxy's forwarded requests are still gated at request
 * time (the forwarded-header tripwire refuses them without consent). Only the
 * actual bind exposing the port is a boot-time consent question; externalUrl's
 * consent need surfaces at request time where a proxy actually appears.
 *
 * The boot path that enforces this MUST resolve `allowExternal`
 * scope-correctly — through `mergeLayered` over all three layers (which skips
 * the committed project layer for the project-local consent leaf), or by
