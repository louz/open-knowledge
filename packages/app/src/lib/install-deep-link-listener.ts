/**
 * Install a subscriber for the Desktop `ok:deep-link` bridge event. When
 * an `openknowledge://` URL routes to this window, main fires the bridge
 * event with `{ doc, kind, branch? }`; this installer updates
 * `window.location.hash` so the existing hash-route listener in App opens
 * the target.
 *
 * The hash form dispatches on `evt.kind` (see `encodeShareTargetForHash`):
 *   - `kind: 'doc'` → `#/<doc>`, with `branch` riding as a `?branch=<encoded>`
 *     query param when present (mirrors the `?anchor=...` pattern in
 *     `doc-hash.ts`). Absent / null / empty branch keeps the bare `#/<doc>`
 *     form — back-compat with legacy emitters preserved.
 *   - `kind: 'folder'` → `#/<folderPath>/` (trailing-slash folder form),
 *     matching how in-app folder navigation builds its hash. An empty `doc`
 *     is the content-root sentinel → `#/` (contentDir root). No `?branch=`
 *     is appended: the branch-switch decision resolves upstream before the
 *     dispatched window navigates.
 *
 * Registered imperatively during main.tsx module init (not inside a React
 * effect) so the `ipcRenderer.on` listener is in place before the main process
 * fires the event on `dom-ready` or later.
 *
 * Dispatched-window toast: in the dispatched window of a multi-worktree
 * share-receive, emit a brief toast naming the branch + worktree path.
 * The deep-link payload carries the branch the share asked for; the
 * window already knows its own `projectPath` via `bridge.config`.
 *
 * Suppressed when:
 *   - the share carried no branch (legacy single-clone receivers'
 *     shares pre-branch-awareness — nothing useful to disambiguate)
 *   - the dispatcher signals `multiCandidate === false` / absent
 *     single-clone receivers — the user has one window matching the
 *     repo, so confirmation copy adds noise without disambiguation
 *     value)
 *
 * Toasts only when `multiCandidate === true`: the dispatcher's
 * candidate-selection had >1 entries, the user's window choice was
 * non-trivial, and the receiver benefits from knowing which window
 * the share landed in.
 *
 * No-op in web / CLI distribution (window.okDesktop undefined). In Desktop,
 * returns the bridge-provided unsubscribe so the caller can detach on
 * hot-module-replacement or teardown.
