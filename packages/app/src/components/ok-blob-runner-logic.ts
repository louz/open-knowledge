 * and writes the resulting positions and deformations straight to element
 * styles, so this module stays testable against a fake clock.
 *
 * The blob is not a ball on a track. Its default state is a continuous hop —
 * it boings along the ground on its own, squashing on contact and stretching
 * through the air — and the player only intervenes to clear something. Squash
 * and stretch are derived from the live physics (`deformationOf`) rather than
 * from CSS keyframes, so the animation and the collision box can never
 * disagree about the shape the blob is currently in.
 *
 * Coordinate box: x grows rightward from the play area's left edge, y grows
 * UPWARD from the ground line. Units are CSS pixels; time is seconds.
