/**
 * OkBlobRunner — the offline-dino easter egg, starring the OK blob.
 *
 * Takes over the mascot slot on error screens where the user is waiting on
 * something outside their control (the collab server being unreachable) rather
 * than being asked to act. At rest it is pixel-identical to the sleeping blob
 * it replaces, so the error screen still reads as an error screen; the game
 * only exists once the user pokes it.
 *
 * Pointer and keyboard both drive it. The error fallbacks focus their "Try
 * again" button on mount and Space activates it, so the key handler stands
 * down whenever focus sits on an interactive element: Space belongs to the
 * focused control until the player deliberately engages the game by clicking
 * the track, which blurs that control. Tab moves back out and hands Space
 * back. That keeps the recovery affordance intact without giving up keyboard
 * play, which the earlier pointer-only rule did.
 *
 * Rendering deliberately bypasses React during a run: the physics live in a
 * ref, and each frame writes transforms straight to pooled DOM nodes. React
 * state changes only on phase transitions (three times per run).
