/**
 * Server-hosted ACP threads — one spawned agent subprocess per thread,
 * bridged to browser/Electron clients over the `/collab/thread` WS.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - Own the agent process lifecycle (spawn → initialize → session/new →
 *     prompt turns → kill on close/shutdown/idle-reap).
 *   - Implement the client side of ACP: session/update fan-out,
 *     permission requests (policy-gated via `AcpPermissionStore`), and the
 *     `fs/*` services — the attribution path that routes agent edits of
 *     in-scope markdown through the CRDT write spine instead of raw disk.
 *   - Retain a bounded per-thread event log so a reconnecting client can
 *     replay from its last-seen seq (the WS-replay analog of the
 *     "durable truth + live push" recovery contract).
 *
 * Write attribution: markdown writes reuse `AgentSessionManager` sessions
 * keyed by a per-thread `acp-<uuid>` agent id, so every edit lands under a
 * per-session frozen paired-write origin (precedent #24) and books to the
 * `agent-*` writer namespace (precedent #25) — write-flash, activity panel,
 * and per-session undo all work exactly as MCP agent writes do.
