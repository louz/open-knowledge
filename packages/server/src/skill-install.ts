 * that CLI's host detection and created a skill dir in all ~75 hosts it knows,
 * so one `ok init` wrote 51 tool-config dirs for tools the user had never
 * installed (issue #820). Nothing about that dependency was load-bearing: OK
 * passes a local path (no source resolution), forces `--copy` (no symlinks),
 * and the CLI writes no lockfile or state at global scope — it contributed a
 * directory table, which OK already maintains in core for project scope. It
 * also cost a floating-range `npx -y` fetch-and-execute at init time and
 * third-party telemetry OK never opted out of.
 *
 * Destinations: `${home}/.<host>/skills/<name>/` for each detected host,
 * including the central `${home}/.agents/skills/<name>/` store only when its
 * root already exists — and NOTHING when no host is detected (`'no-hosts'`),
 * so a machine with no agent tooling gets no dirs at all. See
 * `detectUserSkillHosts` for why that gate is load-bearing.
 *
 * Idempotency: the `cli-hosts` entry in `${home}/.ok/skill-state.yml` gates
 * re-install. Nothing is written (and `'skip-current'` is returned) only when
 * BOTH the recorded version matches the current
 * `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server` package version AND the skill directory is
 * still present under at least one currently installed host root. The
 * disk-presence check exists because a manual `rm` of the skill leaves the
 * state file untouched, which would otherwise wedge the next `ok init` into a
 * no-op despite the skill being gone.
 *
 * Always resolves (never throws). Returns `'failed'` when no usable install
 * could be RECORDED — every destination write errored, a pre-write dependency
 * was missing (version read, bundled asset), or the state-file write failed
 * after the copies landed. That last case is why `'failed'` does not imply
 * "nothing on disk": the skill dirs exist but the version gate never advanced,
 * so the next run reinstalls rather than skipping. A partial host failure is
 * the opposite — it records the version and returns `'installed'`, because the
 * surviving copies are usable.
