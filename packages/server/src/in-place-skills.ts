/**
 * In-place skill registry pre-pass (spec: in-place skill versioning).
 *
 * Scan a base dir's editor host skill dirs for bundles, content-hash each
 * (reusing `parseSkillDir`), and dedup via `buildSkillRegistry` — one entry per
 * distinct-CONTENT identity, same-content copies excluded. Two same-named
 * bundles holding different bytes are two skills and both are listed; the name
 * alone was never the identity. Two tiers share the machinery:
 *
 *  - PROJECT (`scanInPlaceSkills(contentDir)`): the canonical dirs become the
 *    `ContentFilter.inPlaceSkillDirs` allow-list (versioned content; boot +
 *    live re-scan on host-dir change).
 *  - GLOBAL (`scanGlobalInPlaceSkills(home)`): user-home editor dirs
 *    (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, …). Global skills are NOT
 *    content (no per-user content root); the scan feeds the skills list, and
 *    `resolveGlobalNativeSkillDir` resolves `__skill__/global/<name>` docs to
 *    the native dir when the `~/.ok/skills` store has no entry.
